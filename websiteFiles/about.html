  <h2 class="about-font">About Me</h2>
  <p class="about-font"><span class="question">Where am I from?</span>
		I was born and raised in the central district of seattle, wa. Recently I moved to Tukwila but still find myself in Seattle often.</p>
<p class="about-font"><span class="question">Why did I choose to start a career in web development?</span>
  		I've always been interested in web development, learning bits and pieces for years. I decided to make the jump to full-time freelance web developer when I realized the value I can give to architectural firms, after noticing that many Seattle firms have websites that can be improved.
  		The thing that attracts me most to web development is the process of creating something that started as just a idea. I've always been a hands on type of person. When you add that to the fact that now is a perfect time for learning anything(with unlimited resources available online) I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to advance my career and make an impact on Seattle's economy.</p>
    <p class="about-font"><span class="question">Why is my focus on the architectural field?</span>
  		I admire what architects create. They represent the neighborhoods, cities, states and countries they design for. When you are in an area, familiar or unfamiliar, one of the first things you notice are the landmarks. You see the buildings, parks and structures around you. It took an architect to carefully plan that. They have a very strong influence on everyone's experience in this city especially.
  		While admiring their work I often find myself on the designer's website and I quickly noticed a trend. Many are not up to date or using the current web design practices that are essential for businesses to thrive. It's simple, I saw a field that I enjoy and can bring value to and I'm dedicating my time to helping them. With so much development going on in the city I'd love to help as many architectural firms stay in business as I can.</p>
    <p class="about-font"><span class="question">What do I do in my free time?</span>
  Most of my free time goes to my family. I have a daughter who's a year and a half and really into causing chaos, when I'm not running after her or spending time with my significant other I'm catching up on what's going on in the world.</p>

      <h2 class="about-font fa-top">Step 1: Investigation</h2>
      <p class="about-font">The first and most crucial step in any project I start would be to investigate. This is where I find out the criteria for your website, get to know your business better and figure out which ways I can provide value. Everything I do is based on value, so it's extremely important for me to get an understanding of if my services will be a good fit for your business from the beginning.</p>

      <h2 class="about-font fa-top">Step 2: Wireframing</h2>
      <p class="about-font">Once we've came up with ways I can improve your online presence through your website I can start sketching out different ideas. At this point you'll know the changes that can be made and why it's important to make them. This is the fun part because youll get to see a few different ways those changes can be made.</p>

      <h2 class="about-font fa-top">Step 3: Development</h2>
      <p class="about-font">Once we decide on the design to go with I'll began developing your new and improved website. I'll keep you updated on the progress I'm making and you'll get to see working examples of your site before we finalize the project. This is the last step before I hand the code over to you.</p>
