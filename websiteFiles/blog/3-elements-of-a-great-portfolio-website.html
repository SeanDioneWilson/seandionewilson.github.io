  <div class="introduction">
    <p class="about-font">A well-designed portfolio will certainly make you stand out from your competition.
When it comes to having a great portfolio that showcases your skills extremely well there are a few common elements shared among the best. Here are three of those elements. </p>


  </div>

  <!-- tip 1 -->
  <div class="tip1">
  <p class="firm-name">Originality</p>
  <p class="about-font">One of the worst things you can do to your brand is to put zero effort into showing your unique personality. When your portfolio site looks the same as everyone else's it gets an equal amount of attention. But when you bring a unique perspective to showing your work you're able to rise above the static. </p>
  <p class="about-font">Naturally, as human beings we pay more attention to what stands out. There are many ways in which you can use that to your advantage. The simplest to implement are to focus on your website's visuals and to be selective when deciding what projects to include. </p>
  <p class="about-font">People form first impressions extremely fast, so if you're able to direct their opinions about you that will be very beneficial in the long run. Use professionally taken pictures and post an exciting selfie on your "about" page.  When it comes to your project samples, understand that most people will not study your website. They'll simply skim through and click on whatever catches their eye. So try limiting your examples to 10-15 of your highest quality works. </p>
  </div>

  <!-- tip 2 -->
  <div class="tip2">
  <p class="firm-name">Freshness</p>
  <p class="about-font">Always keep it fresh! Constantly rotate which projects you showcase, to show off your most recent skills. If you're doing everything right, you're projects will only get better. There's nothing worse than showing off an old sample when you’ve improved so much more. Do yourself a favor and constantly find ways to grow. Keep an eye on what styles/practices in your field are trending and ride the waves. </p>
  <p class="about-font">If you want extra points then you can try to anticipate future trends and be the first to give a unique view to them. </p>
  </div>

  <!-- tip 3 -->
<div class="tip3">
<p class="firm-name">Examples of your current ability</p>
<p class="about-font">Sometimes you can keep your portfolio fresh and still run into the issue of not properly showing off your current ability. Don’t be scared to push the limits of your comfort and take risks. Staying in your comfort zone for too long can be a safe, secure way of acquiring leads for your service. But it can also be the best way to ensure your potential customers have no issue with going to your competition.  </p>
<p class="about-font">
If you're currently able to do more than what your portfolio showcases then you should in fact be doing more. For example if you're currently able to manage a larger project, produce better results and stand out even more, then do it. </p>
<p class="about-font">
It's not uncommon for individuals in creative fields to not take certain risks out of fear. Getting over that will propel you to the next level. </p>
