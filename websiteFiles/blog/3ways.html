  <!-- introduction -->
  <div class="introduction">
    <p class="about-font">If you aren't tracking your website's conversion rate you need to get on it as soon as possible. Your conversion rate is the percentage of people who take a desired action. For example, if you have a website for your architect firm and your goal is to get your website visitors to set up a consultation here's how you would calculate your conversion rate: (the amount of people who set up a consultation)/(the total amount of visitors to your site) = %</p>
    <p class="about-font">This is important to monitor because it's a vital piece of information that will tell you what marketing efforts are working and where to make adjustments. No matter what your current conversion rate is, how are 3 easy things you can do today to increase it.</p>
    <p class="about-font">I chose these 3 things because of the power they pack when done correctly. If you make these changes you can take your website from being an lead-creation dessert to a jungle of potential customers ready to talk about doing business with you.  </p>

  </div>
  <!-- tip 1 -->
  <div class="tip1">
  <p class="firm-name">Tip # 1: Include Testimonials</p>
  <p class="about-font">We rely more on others when it comes to our decision making than we care to admit. We are constantly searching for reviews of everything before we decide to take that final leap into purchasing. Testimonials are used to strengthen your brand's credibility in the same way reviews are. You can have the greatest product or service around but if your brand is not trusted than people will simply not do business with you. </p>
  <p class="about-font">If you go above and beyond to satisfy your customers they will be more than willing to provide you with testimonials. Don’t be scared to ask.   </p>
  </div>

  <!-- tip 2 -->
  <div class="tip2">
  <p class="firm-name">Tip #2: Humanize Your Website</p>
  <p class="about-font">When someone arrives to your website do they see another generic business or a brand they can relate to? Its extremely important to give your brand a human feel to it. Your visitor should become emotionally invested in your website. There are different ways you can do this and after a quick google search how is some of the advice. </p>
  <p class="about-font">
  <ol>
    <li>Put effort into your About-Us page</li>
    <li>Create videos for your site</li>
    <li>Show passion about your product or service</li>
  </ol> </p>
    <p class="about-font">Make sure your visitors know who's behind your business. Putting effort into your About page will help tell the story of the people who make your business possible. Creating videos will make you stand out and display more emotion than you can through text. And showing passion for your product or service will give your visitors even more reason to invest in you. </p>
  </div>

  <!-- tip 3 -->
  <div class="tip3">
  <p class="firm-name">Tip #3: Include Calls to Action</p>
  <p class="about-font">You wouldn’t guess how many websites I come across that have little to no calls to action. Seeing that automatically tells me their conversion rate is very close to 0%. If you were to go into a store that didn’t have labeled isles or customer service associates to help direct your journey you'd probably look around about and end up walking out without getting anything. But if you were greeted by a customer service associate who helped you and directed you to the isle that fit your needs you'd be more likely to make a purchase. </p>
  <p class="about-font">
Your website needs to tell your visitors where to go. If you want people to set up a consultation then make sure your site convinces them and then nudges them in that direction. If you want them to buy a certain product or sign up for you email list then tell them to. Have buttons, images and other signs to tell them what to do. Its that simple. I hate coming across websites that have no calls to action, because most of the time it's not on purpose.  </p>
