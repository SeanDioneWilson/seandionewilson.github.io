<!-- how did i come up with the design and development -->
<div class="container intro">

<div class="blog-intro">
  <p class="about-font">As a web developer that focuses primarily on the architect field I view hundreds of architect firm websites every month. Within the first few seconds I can tell which sites will go into my list of inspiration or which sites I'll personally reach out to with advice on what they should do to make improvements. When a website is designed and developed exceptionally well it's not something the average end-user notices but it's something that is highly appreciated.</p>

  <p class="about-font">A website that is mobile friendly, has clear call to actions and is designed with simplicity in mind are just a few aspects I look at when it comes to adding websites to my list of "Inspirational Architect Firm Websites". As we approach 2018 I noticed a trend with the best sites showcasing their best or most recent projects on their homepage and sticking more towards a color them of 2 contrasting colors.</p>

  <p class="about-font">This month I took notice of 5 sites in particular that I just love and know will be of some inspiration to you.</p>
</div>

<!---example 1- -->
<div class="inspiration-example">

  <p class="firm-name">1. Miller Hayashi Architects</p>

  <p class="about-font"><span class="bold">Website: </span><a href="http://millerhayashi.com/" target="_blank" class="about-font"> http://millerhayashi.com/</a></p>

  <p class="about-font"><span class="bold">Who are they:</span> An amazing firm that does amazing projects ranging from community centers to elementary schools.</p>

  <p class="about-font"><span class="bold">What I love about their website:</span> Being that the theme of this list is simplicity, this firm has that mastered on their website. Other than the navigation items and copyright information there are no words on their homepage which showcases just a few of the many great projects they've completed. Those projects are placed in an intuitive carousel that you can either navigate with a click of an arrow or drag with your mouse.</p>
  <p class="about-font">Each of their project sections feature the work they've done in that particular category in sort of a blog format, where each project is stacked on the previous one along with a short description.</p>
  <p class="about-font">The overall simplicity and easy to navigate functionality is what lands this website on our list today.</p>
</div>

<!-- example 2 -->
<div class="inspiration-example">

  <p class="firm-name">2. Dean Alan Architects pllc</p>

  <p class="about-font"><span class="bold">Website: </span><a href="http://www.deanalanarchitects.com/" target="_blank" class="about-font"> http://www.deanalanarchitects.com/</a></p>

  <p class="about-font"><span class="bold">Who are they:</span> A woman owned firm with over 20 years of experience in the industry. Their projects include commercial, medical, public and residential building along with airport terminals.</p>

  <p class="about-font"><span class="bold">What I love about their website:</span> of the many things I can choose to talk about, I love the homepage of this website. It takes simplicity to a new level by featuring an automatic scrolling carousel that doesn’t even have arrows for you to control. The projects that are featured look absolutely amazing and pretty much scream "click me!" as they scroll by. If I personally was in the market looking for an architect firm I would be filled with confidence in this firm by visiting their website.</p>

  <p class="about-font">Their website is clean and to the point.</p>

</div>

<!-- example 3 -->
<div class="inspiration-example">

  <p class="firm-name">3. Kruger Architecture</p>

  <p class="about-font"><span class="bold">Website: </span><a href="http://www.krugerarchitecture.com/" target="_blank" class="about-font"> http://www.krugerarchitecture.com/</a></p>


  <p class="about-font"><span class="bold">Who are they:</span> They are a design office specializing in contemporary residential and commercial projects.</p>

  <p class="about-font"><span class="bold">What I love about their website:</span> beyond the fact they fit perfectly in this week's them of simplicity, this firm does something amazingly well with their website that even the best of websites sometimes forget to do. This firm has a few different ways it directs the user's experience when arriving to their site, which  I'm sure they see a positive impact by doing so. As a matter of fact I'll write a post dedicated to this topic soon. For now let's look at the ways this firm does just that.</p>

  <p class="about-font">The moment I arrive to their website one thing stands out. When I take a look at their navigation menu instead of having a "home" option they have a "start here" link item. That fantastic thing about this is if I was to find their site from somewhere else on the internet and not end up on the homepage I'm pressured to click that link item. And once I click the link item I'm welcomed by some featured projects and a nice call to action at the bottom of the page that says "let's set up a call". Having that small call to action is a great step up from simply being a site to show off your projects and a site that aims to generate leads. Good for them, I'm honestly proud to see that.</p>
</div>


<!-- example 4 -->
<div class="inspiration-example">

  <p class="firm-name">4. Nk Architects</p>

  <p class="about-font"><span class="bold">Website: </span><a href="https://www.nkarch.com/" target="_blank" class="about-font"> https://www.nkarch.com/</a></p>

  <p class="about-font"><span class="bold">Who are they:</span> A firm dedicated to accelerate the transition to clean energy buildings. They have the most Passivhaus certified designers and consultants than any other firm in the west.</p>

  <p class="about-font"><span class="bold">What I love about their website:</span> This firm is definitely the largest of the list so far, and you can tell by visiting their website. The thing that stands out to me the most on their website is the wording of ther navigation items. "why work with us", "who we are" and "what we design" give them a unique voice among the industry that gives their brand a more conversational human feel.</p>

  <p class="about-font">When you visit their homepage you're greeted by a large tagline "climate action, building by building" that explains to you right away what they stand for. If you spend a few seconds reading it you'll be amazed to see a transition from day to night happening in front of your eyes. I can dedicate a full article to this site alone and I just might, but for now I'll leave it at those few elements to justify why they are included in this list.</p>
</div>

<!-- example 5 -->
<div class="inspiration-example">
  <p class="firm-name">5. Schacht Aslani Architects</p>

  <p class="about-font"><span class="bold">Website: </span><a href="http://www.saarch.com/" target="_blank" class="about-font"> http://www.saarch.com/</a></p>

  <p class="about-font"><span class="bold">Who are they: An architect firm dedicated to working with issues of gathering, learning and culture. </span></p>

  <p class="about-font"><span class="bold">What I love about their website:</span> here's another website I can dedicate a full article to, but for the sake of time I'll stick to a few points.</p>

  <p class="about-font">When you visit their project page you'll notice a nice functionality that only the largest of architect firms include on their websites, the ability to filter project by type(without a page reload). This is a feature that  website visitors just love. As a matter of fact I recently read an article from an editor on ArchDaily that explained how much they love that feature because it simplifies the process of featuring certain projects on their website. They view hundred of architect websites monthly to find projects to feature and having the ability to filter projects by type dramatically reduces their searching time.</p>

  <p class="about-font">Another thing I love about this site is that they have a small paragraph explaining their vision on their homepage directly underneath the carousel. The great thing about something like this is that it sends a message to your visitor that says "hey, we produce great work but we also have a great meaning behind our work". In terms of standing out from the competition that gives them the leg up because many firms, especially here in the NW produce great work. But there aren't as many firms that also try convincing their website visitors to like more than the work they produce.</p>

  <p class="about-font">Look at it this way, if you had to choose who to do business with between these following two options who would you choose?</p>

  <p class="about-font"><span class="bold">Option 1:</span> firm that produces great work but you don’t know much else about them</p>

  <p class="about-font"><span class="bold">Option 2:</span> firm that produces great work and you know that their vision is to create memorable places which is something you agree with or stand for.</p>

  <p class="about-font">Youll most likely choose option 2.</p>
</div>






<p class="about-font">At the end of the day every firm on this list has an amazing website that gives them a really professional image. While some firms take it to the next level by humanizing their brand or having call to actions that definitely has a positive impact on their sales, even the ones that don’t are light years ahead of many of the websites I come across.</p>

<p class="about-font">If after reading this you're wondering about the ways in which you can improve your own site don’t hesitate to reach out to me, I would love to help. These improvements are usually inexpensive and simple to make but they go a long way, just ask the top producing architect firms out there. Congratulations to everyone who made it on the list and I look forward to seeing who will be featured next. </p>
